# Seedling School

## 01 - Frontend Project

For your first project, you will build a frontend website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website will communicate and integrate with a 3rd party Web API.

## Goals

These are the required goals for the project. Every project should _at least_ meet these goals.

* General
  * Demonstrate your ability to build basic multi page frontend websites
  * Demonstrate your ability to deploy a website to the web so anyone can access it
  * Demonstrate your ability to debug code with the chrome / firefox dev tools
  * Demonstrate your ability to manage a project with a tool like trello
* HTML
  * Demonstrate your ability to create html pages that link to each other
  * Demonstrate your ability to use semantic HTML tags
  * Demonstrate your ability to use accessible alt tags
* JavaScript
  * Demonstrate your ability to take in user input
  * Demonstrate your ability to make API requests with front-end JavaScript
  * Demonstrate your ability to use and manipulate data from a 3rd party web API
  * Demonstrate your ability to handle errors gracefully
  * Demonstrate your ability to traverse and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) with Vanilla JS (No frameworks like Vue or libraries like jQuery)
* CSS
  * Demonstrate your ability to use a CSS Framework (Like Bootstrap or Bulma) to create responsive and adaptive layouts

## Stretch Goals

Not required, but if you want to go above and beyond:

* Mobile first approach
* SEO friendly tags
* UI Animations
* Build process with babel / webpack / scss / less
* Use plain CSS with Flexbox / grid instead of a CSS Framework
* Settings persitence in the browser with Local Storage or IndexDB
  * Hard coded username / password checked against local storage
* Structure your javascript code in an MV* pattern (No 3rd libraries)
* Use a state management pattern in your JavaScript code (No 3rd libraries)
* Multiple pages with DOM manipulation (SPA) instead of multiple html files.
* Document JavaScript with JSDoc
* E2E testing
* PWA
* Any constraint you want to put on yourself to get better at a particular technology
  * Only ES5 (No Es6+ features)
  * Functional Programming
* 100% lighthouse score
* Use a CI / CD pipeline

## What you will build

Your website should have 2 HTML pages.

* 1st Page - Landing Page
  * Title of the project
  * Description of the project
    * What it is
    * Why you built it
    * How people can use it
  * Link to your github / portfolio site
  * Link to the 2nd page (Application page)
* 2nd Page - Application Page
  * Will take in user input
    * For example
      * Search form
      * Settings check boxes
  * Use user input to contact a 3rd party API for data
